# Real-Time-Object-Detection-System-using-OpenCV
Developed a real-time object detection system using OpenCV’s DNN module with YOLOv4 and MobileNet-SSD. Supports image, video, and webcam detection with a Tkinter GUI. Implemented preprocessing, bounding boxes, NMS, and model optimization for fast and accurate multi-class detection.
